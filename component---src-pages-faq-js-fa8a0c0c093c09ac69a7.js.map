No late applications will be considered, and if you\r\n          miss the deadline, you will have to wait an entire year before\r\n          retrying!\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"What does the application process look like?\">\r\n          There are two steps: a written form and an interview. The written form\r\n          will ask you to answer questions related to your interest in iGEM, the\r\n          subteam(s) you’re applying to, experience, skills, and knowledge (we\r\n          may also assess your taste in memes). We’ll then invite candidates to\r\n          an interview where you’ll meet this year’s subteam leads, tell us more\r\n          about yourself, and ask us any questions! Finally, we’ll select our\r\n          members for this year’s team. Our recruitment process typically spans\r\n          2-4 weeks in January each year.\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"Can I apply to multiple subteams?\">\r\n          Yep! And you can receive interviews for multiple subteams as well!\r\n          However, if you are accepted to the team, you will receive an offer to\r\n          only one subteam. Our leads will discuss your preferences and where\r\n          they think you’ll be the best fit in your interview.\"\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"What do you look for in my application?\">\r\n          See our{\" \"}\r\n          <Link className=\"font-nunito text-teal text-base\" to={`/timeline`}>\r\n            Team page\r\n          </Link>{\" \"}\r\n          for more information about what each subteam looks for!\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"What grades do I need to have to apply?\">\r\n          Our team does not assess grades in the application process, and there\r\n          is no grade requirement for being a team member. However, if you are\r\n          struggling academically, we encourage you to assess if you will be\r\n          able to handle your academics alongside the large time commitment of\r\n          being a Waterloo iGEM member.\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"How many new members do you accept yearly?\">\r\n          There are no quotas for the number of members accepted to each subteam\r\n          each year. Numbers vary depending on applicants, availability\r\n          throughout the year, and number of returning members.\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"Is attending an info session mandatory?\">\r\n          No, but one of the main characteristics all subteams look for is\r\n          enthusiasm towards being a member of iGEM. One of the best ways to\r\n          demonstrate this is attending our events throughout the year, such as\r\n          our information sessions, workshops, and presentations!\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"I haven’t heard back from you about the status of my application or after my interview.\">\r\n          We make it clear at the end of the written application and interview\r\n          when to expect a response from us. If there is a delay in the\r\n          decision-making process, we will notify you via email. As always,\r\n          check your email regularly, especially your spam folder. If you have\r\n          not received an email 24 hours after you were told to expect one,\r\n          please email us to make sure your email address was entered in your\r\n          application correctly.\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n        <Accordion title=\"I didn’t receive an offer.

Our team\r\n          will be meeting remotely and will not have access to our lab until the\r\n          university deems it safe to regather on-campus. However, iGEM has made\r\n          it possible to succeed (and win!) at the competition without lab work,\r\n          and we did exactly that in 2020!\r\n        </Accordion>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
