This enables a variety of important interactions including co-metabolism and nutrient cycling. Yet, it can be difficult to culture species together in a laboratory setting. Mixed populations are difficult to maintain primarily due to competition: a difference in growth rates often results in one population outcompeting another. Our team aimed to dynamically control E. coli growth by using optogenetics (light-induced gene expression) to regulate the production of MetE, an enzyme essential for bacterial growth. This kind of control could help us overcome a major barrier to maintaining co-cultures: competition between microorganisms. This would open several doors in biotech and research. For instance, metabolic engineering of microbial communities may improve the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and other important materials. Moreover, controllable co-cultures would allow researchers to explore complex interactions between microbes and investigate questions that could not previously be answered due to co-culturing limitations.\",\r\n    achievements: [\"Silver Medal recipient\"],\r\n    backgroundColour: \"bg-ecolight\",\r\n    textColour: \"text-white\",\r\n    wiki: \"http://2018.igem.org/Team:Waterloo\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    year: 2017,\r\n    title: \"Prions Be Lit\",\r\n    logo: require(\"../../images/PrionsBeLit.png\"),\r\n    imgSize: \"w-48\",\r\n    tagline: \"Functional Amyloid as a Biological Tool\",\r\n    abstract: \"Prions are perhaps most famous for their implication in neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are also proteins that bear strong similarities to prions while not being associated with an infectious disease. These proteins have been deemed “functional prions.” In our project, engineered functional prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided a proof of concept for using prions as a tool in synthetic biology to co-localize different proteins. These engineered proteins have prion-like aggregative behaviour, as well as a fluorescent tag. They will be used to test the viability of using engineered prions to bring and keep proteins in close proximity to each other while maintaining their function.\",\r\n    achievements: [\"We had fun :)\"],\r\n    backgroundColour: \"bg-prions\",\r\n    textColour: \"text-white\",\r\n    wiki: \"http://2017.igem.org/Team:Waterloo\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    year: 2016,\r\n    title: \"OFF to priON\",\r\n    logo: require(\"../../images/OffToPrion.png\"),\r\n    imgSize: \"w-56\",\r\n    tagline: \"Using stop codon read-through and CRISPR to explore S. cerevisiae prion mechanisms\",\r\n    abstract: \"Prions, or “zombie proteins,” are infectious agents that lead to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). They sicken cells by aggregating with each other and prevent proper protein folding, leading to cell death from the accumulated damage. We proposed a synthetic biology approach to better study prion propagation in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Our system involved inserting a premature stop codon into a protein open reading frame of interest or into dCas9 to respectively overexpress or knock-down protein levels during a [PSI+] response. We used Hsp104, a chaperone protein in S. cerevisiae, to demonstrate that our set-up phenotypically responds to the stop codon readthrough. This research is useful for continuously observing a phenotypic output during prion propagation in yeast and may have implications for helping to identify protein targets for both prevention and treatment of NDDs in the future.\",\r\n    achievements: [\"Best Poster winner\", \"Gold Medal recipient\"],\r\n    backgroundColour: \"bg-off\",\r\n    textColour: \"text-white\",\r\n    wiki: \"http://2016.igem.org/Team:Waterloo\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    year: 2015,\r\n    title: \"CRISPieR\",\r\n    logo: require(\"../../images/crispier.png\"),\r\n    imgSize: \"h-36\",\r\n    tagline: \"Re-engineering CRISPR-Cas9 with functional applications in eukaryotic systems\",\r\n    abstract: \"CRISPR-Cas9 is an exciting tool for synthetic biologists because it can target and edit genomes with unprecedented specificity. Our team attempted to re-engineer CRISPR to make it more flexible and easier to use. We made it easy to test different sgRNA designs by adding restriction sites to the sgRNA backbone to allow 20 nucleotide target sequences to be swapped without excessive cloning. Additionally, we’re applying recent research on viable mutations within Cas9’s PAM-interacting domain to design (d)Cas9 variants that bind to novel PAM sites, moving towards the goal of a suite of variants that can bind any desired sequence. We believe our re-engineered CRISPR-Cas9 will give biologists increased ability to optimize targeting in many applications. The application we chose to explore is a proof-of-concept antiviral system defending the model plant Arabidopsis against Cauliflower Mosaic Virus, which would benefit from testing a large number of possible sgRNAs in the viral genome.\",\r\n    achievements: [\"Best Foundational Advance Project nominee\", \"Best Software Tool winner\", \"Best Poster winner\", \"Gold Medal recipient\"],\r\n    backgroundColour: \"bg-crispier\",\r\n    textColour: \"text-white\",\r\n    wiki: \"http://2015.igem.org/Team:Waterloo\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    year: 2014,\r\n    title: \"Staphylocide\",\r\n    logo: require(\"../../images/staphylocide.png\"),\r\n    imgSize: \"h-36\",\r\n    tagline: \"Staphylocide: Delivery of an Antibiotic Resistance Gene Silencing Mechanism to a MRSA Population using Bacterial Conjugation\",\r\n    abstract: \"Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA) is an infection-causing pathogen that poses serious health threats in hospitals and in the community. They are well known for their resistance to all β-lactams due to the expression of the mecA gene from the mec cassette. We proposed to combat this infection by delivering gene-silencing systems CRISPRi and RNAi through a Staphylococcus conjugative plasmid. This will effectively disable the antibiotic resistant phenotype over time so that a β-lactam antibiotic can then be administered to kill the MRSA. As a proof of concept, our gene silencing mechanisms targeted a YFP gene within a Staphylococcus population.
