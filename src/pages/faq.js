          Our ideal applicant demonstrates passion about the field of synthetic
          biology, commitment to work hard and do your best, perseverance when
          experiments are long and/or do not go as planned, and ability to
          collaborate with other members. Our ideal applicant does NOT need
          previous lab training, especially when applying in first year, but
          research/volunteer experience in science and engineering is considered
          an asset in more senior applicants.
