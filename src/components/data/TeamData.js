        description: "We take the team's project idea, find genetic sequences in literature that code for our desired functions, and insert them into our organism using molecular biology techniques (ex. cloning, PCR, gel electrophoresis). We also contribute to iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts, an open-source database where members of the synthetic biology community share the genetic sequences they’ve characterized so others can insert them into their biological systems.",
        candidate: ["Passion about the field of synthetic biology", "Commitment to work hard and do your best", "Perseverance when experiments are long and/or do not go as planned", "Ability to collaborate with other members", "We do NOT look for previous lab training, especially when applying in first year, but research/volunteer experience in science and engineering is considered an asset in more senior applicants"]

        description: "Science is all about predictive power – in synthetic biology, these predictions come from a variety of sources. The math and modelling team seeks to characterize, develop, and make accurate predictions about the state of our biological system using techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, and computational science. Some of our primary tools are ordinary differential equations, combinatorial mathematics, and numerical analysis.",
        candidate: ["Motivation and interest in applying mathematical techniques to the field of synthetic biology in a project-driven environment", "Any experience in applied mathematics, statistics, mathematical modelling, computer science and related fields is considered an asset for all levels of applicants (we understand that students typically do not substantial experience in mathematical modelling, much less in the biological sciences)"]

        description: "Famously said by Peter Carr, Human Practices is the study of “how our work affects the world and how the world affects our work.” In other words, good science is about more than just producing good results in the lab – we must also explore the human and societal consequences of synthetic biology. Our understanding of potential issues guides the design and implementation of our project to ensure that it is safe, meaningful, and positively impacts the world!",
        candidate: ["Ability to analyze problems from many perspectives and consider all factors when recommending solutions", "Great written and verbal communication skills", "Willingness to step outside of your comfort zone to interview stakeholders and run outreach events"]
