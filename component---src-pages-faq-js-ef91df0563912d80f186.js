(Are you a graduate student? We are always looking for new advisors! Feel free to contact us at any time.)"},{"question":"When can I apply?","answer":"We only have one recruitment cycle per calendar year for all our subteams. Make sure to follow our social media accounts to receive updates about recruitment deadlines and/or refer to the Recruitment timeline in early January. No late applications will be considered, and if you miss the deadline, you will have to wait an entire year before retrying!"},{"question":"What does the application process look like?","answer":"There are two steps: a written form and an interview. The written form will ask you to answer questions related to your interest in iGEM, the subteam(s) you’re applying to, experience, skills, and knowledge (we may also assess your taste in memes). We’ll then invite candidates to an interview where you’ll meet this year’s subteam leads, tell us more about yourself, and ask us any questions! Finally, we’ll select our members for this year’s team. Our recruitment process typically spans 2-4 weeks in January each year."},{"question":"Can I apply to multiple subteams?","answer":"Absolutely, and you can receive interviews for multiple subteams as well! However, if you are accepted to the team, you will receive an offer to only one subteam. Our leads will discuss your preferences and where they think you’ll be the best fit in your interview."},{"question":"What do you look for in my application?","answer":"See our Team page for more information about what each subteam looks for!"},{"question":"What grades do I need to have to apply?","answer":"Our team does not assess grades in the application process, and there is no grade requirement for being a team member. However, if you are struggling academically, we encourage you to assess if you will be able to handle your academics alongside the large time commitment of being a Waterloo iGEM member."},{"question":"How many new members do you accept yearly?","answer":"There are no quotas for the number of members accepted to each subteam each year. Numbers vary depending on applicants, availability throughout the year, and number of returning members."},{"question":"Is attending an info session mandatory?","answer":"No, but one of the main characteristics all subteams look for is enthusiasm towards being a member of iGEM. One of the best ways to demonstrate this is attending our events throughout the year, such as our information sessions, workshops, and presentations!"},{"question":"I haven’t heard back from you about the status of my application or after my interview.","answer":"We make it clear at the end of the written application and interview when to expect a response from us. If there is a delay in the decision-making process, we will notify you via email. As always, check your email regularly, especially your spam folder. If you have not received an email 24 hours after you were told to expect one, please email us to make sure your email address was entered in your application correctly."},{"question":"I didn’t receive an offer. What now?","answer":"Don’t be discouraged! Instead, contact the subteam(s) you applied to and request feedback on your application or interview so you know how to improve next time. We highly encourage you to re-apply!"},{"question":"How is COVID-19 impacting the team’s operation?","answer":"We are conducting our info session and interviews online. Our team will be meeting remotely and will not have access to our lab until the university deems it safe to regather on-campus. However, iGEM has made it possible to succeed (and win!) at the competition without lab work, and we did exactly that in 2020!"}]')},zIjM:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t.r(a),t.d(a,"default",(function(){return u}));var o=t("Wbzz"),n=t("q1tI"),r=t.n(n),s=t("Bl7J"),i=function(e){var a=e.title,t=e.children;return r.a.createElement("section",{className:"w-full bg-gray border rounded-2xl border-transparent cursor-pointer"},r.a.createElement("details",{className:"space-y-2"},r.a.createElement("summary",{className:"focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 text-blue font-bg-r text-lg p-6"},a),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"text-blue font-nunito text-base p-6 pt-0"},t)))},l=t("ZVTb");function u(){var e=l.map((function(e){var a=e.question,t=e.answer;return r.a.createElement(i,{title:a},t)}));return r.a.createElement(s.a,{title:"FAQ"},r.a.createElement("article",{className:"prose max-w-none"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-end md:justify-between mb-8"},r.a.createElement("h1",{className:"border-b-2 border-yellow"},"FAQ"),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-end space-y-4 md:space-y-0 md:space-x-4"},r.a.createElement("h3",{style:{lineHeight:1,marginTop:"0.875em",marginBottom:0}},"Don't see your question?"),r.a.createElement(o.a,{style:{lineHeight:1},to:"/contact"},"Contact us →")))),r.a.createElement("div",{className:"mt-8 flex flex-col gap-4"},e))}}}]);
